**Headline:** 5 Revenue Management Mistakes Killing Your Hotel's Profits (And How to Fix Them Today)

**Body:**

After 15+ years optimizing revenue for boutique hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, and luxury vacation rentals, I've seen the same mistakes repeatedly. These aren't small errors—they're profit killers costing owners tens of thousands annually.

The good news? Every single one is fixable, often within days.

**Mistake #1: Static Pricing That Ignores Demand**

If your room rates stay the same regardless of occupancy, local events, or competitor pricing, you're leaving 30-40% of potential revenue on the table.

I worked with a 40-room boutique hotel charging $175/night year-round. Their occupancy averaged 62%. We implemented dynamic pricing based on real-time demand signals.

Result: 144% revenue increase in 6 months. Same property. Strategic pricing.

**Mistake #2: Paying Too Much for Distribution**

Online travel agencies charge 15-25% commission. If you're not driving direct bookings, you're paying thousands unnecessarily.

A 50-room property at $150/night with 70% OTA bookings pays ~$160K annually in commissions.

Solution: Offer incentives for direct bookings—free breakfast, upgrades, late checkout. Build email lists. Create loyalty programs.

One client reduced OTA dependency from 70% to 35% in 8 months, saving over $80K annually.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Your Comp Set**

Your competition isn't just other hotels—it's every property competing for the same guest: vacation rentals, Airbnbs, other boutiques within 5 miles.

Most owners never analyze competitor pricing, occupancy, or reviews. This is strategic blindness.

Spend 30 minutes weekly reviewing your comp set. If competitors are fully booked at higher rates, you're underpriced.

**Mistake #4: Treating All Rooms Equally**

Your corner suite with ocean views should command premium pricing. Your standard rooms near the elevator should be your value offering.

Segment inventory by desirability. Price best rooms at 30-50% premium. Use standard rooms for promotions.

This strategy alone increased RevPAR by 22% for a 30-room inn I consulted with.

**Mistake #5: No Strategy for Shoulder Seasons**

Most owners accept lower occupancy during slow periods as inevitable. This is a mistake.

Create experience packages. Partner with local businesses. A wine country inn partnered with vineyards for exclusive tastings. They sold out 4 weekends at rates 20% higher than peak season average.

**The Bottom Line**

These mistakes cost real money—money that should be in your pocket.
