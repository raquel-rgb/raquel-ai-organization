## 📝 POST TITLE

You built a $10M business but can't remember the last time you felt alive - anyone else?

## 📝 POST BODY

I work with successful entrepreneurs (35-55) as an executive lifestyle consultant. The pattern I see repeatedly:

• Built successful business ($5M-50M revenue)
• Financially secure
• Respected in their industry
• But feel completely empty inside

**Common symptoms:**

→ Can't remember the last time they felt genuine excitement
→ Relationships feel transactional
→ Sex life is routine or non-existent
→ Success feels hollow
→ Wake up dreading the day despite "having it all"

**This isn't depression.** It's not burnout (though it can lead to both). 

It's what happens when you optimize for business success but completely neglect personal fulfillment.

**The problem:** Business coaching won't fix this. Traditional therapy often doesn't understand the specific pressures of high-level entrepreneurship. Your friends either don't get it or are dealing with their own versions of the same emptiness.

**What actually works:**

1. **Identify what makes you feel ALIVE** (not productive, not successful - ALIVE)
2. **Schedule it like your most important client meeting** (because it is)
3. **Protect that time like your business depends on it** (because your LIFE does)

**Example:**
Client A: 48-year-old founder, $30M exit, felt dead inside
Discovered: He felt most alive when traveling alone and experiencing new cultures
Solution: Solo trip to Japan every quarter, no work allowed
Result: Returned energized, started new company 18 months later, business grew 40% year one

**Another example:**
Client B: 42-year-old CEO, $8M/year revenue, marriage dying
Discovered: He'd abandoned his passion for jazz music decades ago
Solution: Started playing saxophone again, 30 minutes daily, non-negotiable
Result: Not only personal fulfillment returned, but he met his wife at a jazz club 20 years ago - reignited their connection through shared music

**My question for you:**

What makes YOU feel truly alive? When's the last time you did it?

If you can't answer that question, or if it's been years, that's your starting point.

I offer executive lifestyle consulting for exactly this issue. $200/hour, completely confidential.

But honestly? You can start fixing this today without me. Just answer that question and do that thing this week.

DM me if you want to discuss your specific situation, or visit my profile for more info.
