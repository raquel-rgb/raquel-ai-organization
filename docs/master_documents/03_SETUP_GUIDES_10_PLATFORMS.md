**Content Mix:**

- 20% Reblogs (community engagement)

**Posting Schedule:** 2-3 posts per day

**Content Pillars:**

**Pillar 1: Personal Stories and Experiences**

**Post Example:**
"I stripped my way through college for three years. Shaking my curves across clubs throughout the US wasn't desperation - it was strategy. I needed money for school, and I had the body and confidence to make serious cash.

What I learned: Sexuality is as much psychological as physical. The most powerful seduction happens in the mind. That skill, perfected on stage, became my superpower in phone intimacy.

#PersonalStory #ExoticDancer #RealTalk #SexWork #Empowerment"

**Pillar 2: Sex-Positive Education**

**Post Example:**
"Your fantasies don't make you broken. They make you human.

After 15+ years in phone sex with a Master's in Psychosexual Therapy, I can tell you: the shame around desire does more damage than the desire itself.

Whatever you want - it's okay. You're okay.

#SexPositive #Psychology #Desire #NoShame #PhoneSex"

**Pillar 3: Travel Photography and Stories**

**Post Example:**
[Photo of Raquel in Puerto Rico]

"Currently in Puerto Rico reconnecting with my roots. There's something about the island that reminds me who I am beyond all the roles I play.

The ocean. The warmth. The music. The food. This is home.

#PuertoRico #Boricua #Travel #IslandLife #Home"

**Pillar 4: Relationship Advice and Insights**

**Post Example:**
"Why do successful men seek connection outside their marriages?

It's not always about sex. Often it's about feeling truly seen, understood, accepted. About having space to be vulnerable without judgment. About exploring parts of themselves they can't share with anyone else.

That's what I provide. Not just physical release - emotional safety.

**Pillar 5: Fashion and Lifestyle Content**

**Post Example:**
[Photo of Raquel in designer outfit]

"45 and finally comfortable in my own skin. Took me decades to get here, but confidence is sexier than youth ever was.

**Pillar 6: Adult Content (with Community Labels)**
