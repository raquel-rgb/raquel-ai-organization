**Purpose:** Complete step-by-step guide for setting up Raquel's Facebook Business Page and warming up Instagram account to avoid spam filters

---

## 📘 PART 1: FACEBOOK BUSINESS PAGE SETUP

### **WHY FACEBOOK FOR RAQUEL?**

Facebook remains a powerful platform for Raquel's business because it offers several unique advantages that align perfectly with her multi-service model. The platform's demographic skews older, with the majority of users aged 45-70, which directly matches Raquel's target audience of property owners and hospitality managers (Segment 2). Unlike Instagram, Facebook allows for long-form educational content, which is ideal for establishing credibility in professional services like revenue management consulting and executive coaching.

Additionally, Facebook provides more flexibility for adult content when properly marked, allowing Raquel to promote all six services on a single platform. The ability to create Facebook Groups enables community building around specific services, while Facebook's business tools (CTA buttons, appointment booking, messaging) create seamless pathways for client acquisition. Most importantly, Facebook's algorithm still rewards genuine engagement and value-driven content, making it perfect for Raquel's value-first approach.

---

### **STEP 1: CREATE FACEBOOK BUSINESS PAGE**

#### **1.1 Navigate to Page Creation**

Log into your Facebook account (use the third phone number to avoid linking to personal accounts). Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top right corner, then select "Pages" from the menu. Click the "Create New Page" button in the top left corner.

#### **1.2 Choose Page Type**

Select **"Professional"** as the page type, then click "Next." This designation is important because it provides access to business tools, analytics, and advertising features that personal profiles don't offer.

#### **1.3 Page Category Selection**

Choose **TWO categories** to maximize discoverability:

**Primary Category:** "Business Consultant"  
**Secondary Category:** "Entertainment Service"

This dual categorization allows Raquel to appear in searches for both professional consulting services and entertainment/companionship services, accurately reflecting her multi-service business model.

#### **1.4 Page Name**

**Official Page Name:** "Raquel Rivera - Virtual Concierge & Business Consultant"

This name accomplishes several goals. It includes Raquel's personal brand name for recognition, highlights the unique "Virtual Concierge" positioning that differentiates her from competitors, and includes "Business Consultant" for professional credibility. The name is searchable, memorable, and accurately represents the business without being overly promotional.

#### **1.5 Page Username**

**Username:** @RaquelVirtualConcierge

The username creates a custom URL (facebook.com/RaquelVirtualConcierge) that is easy to share, professional, and consistent with branding across other platforms. Keep it short, memorable, and without numbers or special characters.

---

### **STEP 2: OPTIMIZE PAGE VISUALS**

#### **2.1 Profile Picture**

**Specifications:**
- Size: 180 x 180 pixels minimum
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Content: Professional headshot of Raquel

**Best Practices:**
The profile picture should be a close-up headshot showing Raquel's face clearly, with good lighting and a neutral or professional background. This image appears next to every post, comment, and message, so it needs to be recognizable even at small sizes. The photo should convey warmth, professionalism, and approachability - a genuine smile works better than a sultry pose for building trust.

#### **2.2 Cover Photo**

**Specifications:**
- Size: 820 x 312 pixels
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Content: Branded image showcasing services

**Recommended Design:**
Create a professional cover photo that includes:
- Raquel's image (full body or 3/4 shot, professionally dressed)
- Text overlay: "6 Services for Sophisticated Men"
- Icons representing services: ✈️ Travel | 🏨 Hospitality | 💼 Executive Coaching | 💕 Relationship Consulting | 📞 24/7 Available
- Website: latinaphonesex.com
- Phone: 1-844-493-9007

The cover photo is prime real estate for communicating your value proposition. It should be visually appealing, easy to read on mobile devices, and clearly communicate what Raquel offers. Use high-quality images and professional design tools like Canva to create a polished look.

---

### **STEP 3: COMPLETE PAGE INFORMATION**

#### **3.1 About Section**

**Short Description (255 characters max):**

"Raquel Rivera offers professional revenue management consulting, executive coaching, luxury travel expertise, and intimate companionship services for sophisticated men. 15+ years experience. Available 24/7. Discreet and professional."

**Long Description:**

"Welcome to Raquel Rivera's 🇵🇷 official page. I'm a 45-year-old professional offering six distinct services designed for sophisticated, successful men who value expertise, discretion, and genuine connection.

**MY BACKGROUND:** My journey has been unconventional: I stripped my way through college (3 years) to fund my psychology degree, then became a flight attendant - first for commercial airlines, then for private charter jets serving billionaires and celebrities. During those years, I earned my Master's in Psychosexual Therapy. I then spent 15+ years in hospitality revenue management before discovering phone sex in 2010. This unique combination - exotic dancing, luxury service, psychology training, and business expertise - makes me unlike anyone else in this industry.

**MY 6 SERVICES:**

**1. Hospitality Revenue Management** - Custom consulting packages for boutique hotels, B&Bs, and vacation rentals. I help property owners optimize pricing, increase occupancy, and maximize revenue. Typical results: 100-200% revenue increase.

**2. Executive Lifestyle Enhancement** - $200/hour coaching sessions for successful entrepreneurs and executives who feel empty despite their achievements. I help you identify what makes you feel truly alive and create strategies to prioritize it.

**3. Luxury Travel Oracle** - $250/hour consultations providing predictive insights into emerging luxury destinations. With 500,000+ followers trusting my recommendations, I help ultra-wealthy travelers discover exclusive experiences before they trend.

**4. Virtual Travel Concierge** - $157.50 weekend packages providing virtual companionship during business trips and vacations. Morning check-ins, evening video dinner dates, and intimate late-night conversations so you never travel alone.

**5. Relationship Consulting** - $250 per session offering judgment-free guidance on relationships, intimacy, and personal fulfillment. I combine psychology expertise with real-world experience to help men navigate complex relationship challenges.

**6. Phone Intimacy Services** - $4.99/minute ($2.50/minute for first-time callers) available 24/7 at 1-844-493-9007. Over 200 fantasy categories ranging from girlfriend experience to taboo scenarios. Complete discretion guaranteed.

**WHY CHOOSE RAQUEL?**

Unlike generic consultants or transactional services, I offer a holistic approach combining professional expertise with genuine human connection. My psychology background allows me to understand complex needs, while my hospitality experience provides practical business solutions. I'm available 24/7, completely non-judgmental, and committed to absolute discretion.

**CONTACT:**
📞 Phone: 1-844-493-9007 (24/7)
🌐 Website: latinaphonesex.com
💬 Message me here for inquiries
💳 Billing: SolTech Enterprises (discreet)

All services are for entertainment and companionship purposes only. I do not provide medical, psychological, or diagnostic services."

#### **3.2 Contact Information**

**Phone Number:** 1-844-493-9007  
**Email:** raquel@latinaphonesex.com  
**Website:** latinaphonesex.com  
**Location:** Mobile lifestyle - Currently between Miami, San Juan 🇵🇷, and Minneapolis

Adding complete contact information builds credibility and makes it easy for potential clients to reach you. The mobile lifestyle positioning reinforces Raquel's luxury travel expert brand and jet-setter image.

#### **3.3 Hours of Operation**

**Set as:** Open 24/7

This is critical for phone sex services and reinforces availability for busy executives who may only have time to connect late at night or early morning.

#### **3.4 Price Range**

**Set as:** $$ (Moderate)

This positioning is strategic. Setting it as "$$" rather than "$" (inexpensive) or "$$$$" (very expensive) positions Raquel as premium but accessible, which aligns with her pricing structure ($4.99/min for phone sex is moderate, while $250/hour consulting is premium).

---

### **STEP 4: ADD CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTON**

Facebook allows one prominent CTA button at the top of your page. This is valuable real estate that should drive the most important action.

**Recommended CTA:** "Book Now"

**Link Destination:** Create a Linktree or similar landing page with all six services:

**Linktree Structure:**
1. 📞 **Call Me Now** → tel:1-844-493-9007 (Phone Sex - primary revenue)
2. 🏨 **Free Revenue Audit** → Calendly link (Hospitality Consulting)
3. ✈️ **Travel Consultation** → Stripe payment link + Calendly (Travel Oracle)
4. 💼 **Executive Coaching** → Stripe payment link + Calendly (Lifestyle Enhancement)
5. 💕 **Relationship Consulting** → Stripe payment link + Calendly (Relationship)
6. 🌴 **Virtual Travel Companion** → Stripe payment link + booking form (Travel Concierge)

The "Book Now" CTA is more action-oriented than "Learn More" and creates urgency. By linking to a Linktree, you give visitors choice while tracking which services generate the most interest.

---

### **STEP 5: CREATE FACEBOOK GROUP (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)**

Creating a Facebook Group alongside your Page builds community and provides a space for deeper engagement. Groups have higher organic reach than Pages because Facebook prioritizes community content.

**Recommended Group Name:** "Raquel's Revenue Masters"

**Group Purpose:** Community for property owners, hotel managers, and hospitality professionals to share revenue management tips, ask questions, and access exclusive content from Raquel.

**Group Settings:**
- **Privacy:** Private (members must request to join)
- **Visibility:** Visible (people can find it and see who's in it)
- **Membership Questions:** "What type of property do you own/manage?" and "What's your biggest revenue challenge?"

**Group Benefits:**
- Builds community around Segment 2 (Property Owners)
- Provides free value (tips, discussions)
- Positions Raquel as expert
- Creates warm leads for consulting services
- Higher engagement than Page posts

**Content Strategy for Group:**
- Weekly "Revenue Tip Tuesday" posts
- Monthly "Ask Raquel Anything" live sessions
- Member success stories
- Industry news and trends
- Exclusive discounts for group members

---

### **STEP 6: PAGE SETTINGS & PRIVACY**

#### **6.1 Messaging Settings**

**Enable:**
- ✅ Allow people to contact my Page privately
- ✅ Show a greeting message
- ✅ Send automated responses to common questions

**Greeting Message:**
"Hi! Thanks for reaching out to Raquel Rivera. I offer 6 services for sophisticated men: Hospitality Revenue Management, Executive Coaching, Luxury Travel Consulting, Virtual Travel Companionship, Relationship Consulting, and Phone Intimacy (24/7 at 1-844-493-9007). How can I help you today?"

**Automated Responses:**
- **"Services"** → "I offer 6 services: [list with pricing]. Which interests you?"
- **"Pricing"** → "Pricing varies by service: Phone Sex $4.99/min, Executive Coaching $200/hr, Travel Oracle $250/hr, Revenue Management custom packages. What service are you interested in?"
- **"Availability"** → "Phone intimacy is available 24/7 at 1-844-493-9007. Consulting services are by appointment. Would you like to schedule?"

#### **6.2 Page Moderation**

**Profanity Filter:** Off (adult content page)  
**Comment Moderation:** Manual review  
**Message Filtering:** Filter offensive messages

#### **6.3 Page Roles**

Add team members if needed:
- **Admin:** Full control (Yayo, Tina)
- **Editor:** Can create/edit posts (Raquel Assistant)
- **Moderator:** Can respond to comments (if hiring help)

---

### **STEP 7: CONTENT PILLARS FOR FACEBOOK**

Facebook's algorithm rewards consistent, valuable content that generates meaningful engagement. Raquel's content should follow a strategic mix:

#### **Content Pillar 1: Educational (50%)**

**Purpose:** Establish expertise and provide value before selling

**Topics:**
- Revenue management tips for hotels
- Executive productivity strategies
- Relationship communication techniques
- Luxury travel destination insights
- Psychology of success
- Work-life balance strategies

**Format:** Long-form posts (300-500 words), videos, infographics

**Example Post:**
"5 Revenue Management Mistakes Killing Your Hotel's Profits (And How to Fix Them)

After 15+ years optimizing revenue for boutique hotels, I've seen these mistakes repeatedly. Here's what's costing you money:

1. **Static Pricing:** If your rates don't change based on demand, you're leaving 30-40% of potential revenue on the table. Solution: Implement dynamic pricing that adjusts based on occupancy, events, and competitor rates.

2. **Ignoring Distribution Costs:** OTAs charge 15-25% commission. If you're not driving direct bookings, you're paying thousands unnecessarily. Solution: Invest in your website, offer direct booking incentives, and build a loyalty program.

#### **Content Pillar 2: Inspirational/Lifestyle (30%)**

**Purpose:** Build aspirational brand and emotional connection

**Topics:**
- "Living my best life at 45"
- Travel experiences
- Success mindset
- Personal growth stories
- Behind-the-scenes of consulting work

**Format:** Photos with captions, short videos, Stories

**Example Post:**
"Just wrapped a consultation with a hotel owner in Charleston who increased his revenue by 144% in 6 months using the strategies we implemented together. This is why I do what I do - helping people unlock potential they didn't know they had.

Success isn't just about numbers. It's about the confidence that comes from knowing you're optimizing every opportunity. Whether it's your hotel, your career, or your personal life - you deserve to thrive.

What area of your life needs optimization right now?"

#### **Content Pillar 3: Promotional (20%)**

**Purpose:** Direct promotion of services

**Topics:**
- Service offerings

**Format:** Direct, clear, benefit-focused

## 📸 PART 2: INSTAGRAM WARMUP STRATEGY

### **WHY WARMUP IS CRITICAL**

Instagram's algorithm is designed to detect and penalize spam accounts, bot activity, and inauthentic behavior. When a new account is created, Instagram watches closely for signs of automation or spam. If you immediately start posting multiple times per day, following hundreds of accounts, or using banned hashtags, Instagram will flag your account and severely limit your reach - a condition known as "shadowban."

A shadowban means your content won't appear in hashtag searches, your posts won't show up in the Explore page, and your reach will be limited to only your existing followers. For a new account with zero followers, this is devastating. The warmup strategy mimics natural human behavior, gradually building trust with Instagram's algorithm before ramping up to full posting activity.

Additionally, Instagram rewards accounts that demonstrate genuine engagement and community building. By spending the first two weeks engaging with your target audience before posting, you accomplish two goals: you avoid spam detection, and you build an initial audience of people who are already interested in your content. When you finally do post, these engaged users are more likely to like, comment, and share, which signals to Instagram that your content is valuable.

---

### **INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT STATUS**

**Current Status:** Account exists but not active  
**Username:** [To be confirmed - recommend @RaquelVirtualConcierge or @RaquelRivera]  
**Current Activity:** Engaging with target audience content (polo, yachting, golf, luxury lifestyle)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT post anything yet. Continue engagement-only activity for at least 2 weeks from account creation.

---

### **WARMUP PHASE 1: WEEKS 1-2 (ENGAGEMENT ONLY)**

---

### **INSTAGRAM CONTENT GUIDELINES**

**ALLOWED on Instagram:**
✅ Sexy but clothed photos
✅ Bikini/swimwear photos
✅ Suggestive captions (subtle)
✅ "Call me" CTAs
✅ Link in bio to all services
✅ Professional consulting content

**NOT ALLOWED on Instagram:**
❌ Nudity
❌ Explicit sexual content
❌ Graphic language
❌ Direct promotion of phone sex (must be subtle)
❌ Banned hashtags (check before using)

**Subtle Phone Sex Promotion:**
Instead of: "Call me for phone sex at 1-844-493-9007"
Use: "Available 24/7 for intimate conversations. Link in bio for all services."

---

### **HASHTAG STRATEGY**

**OLD RULE (DEAD):** Use 30 hashtags per post  
**NEW RULE (2026):** Use 3-5 highly relevant hashtags

**Why the Change:**
Instagram is now a search engine. The algorithm prioritizes keyword-rich captions over hashtags. Using 30 hashtags looks spammy and can trigger shadowbans.

**Recommended Hashtags:**
- #ExecutiveCoaching
- #LuxuryTravel
- #HospitalityConsulting
- #RevenueManagement
- #VirtualConcierge
- #TravelOracle
- #LifestyleOptimization

**Hashtag Research:**
- Search hashtag before using
- Check if it's banned (search shows "Recent" tab)
- Use mix of popular (100K+ posts) and niche (10K-50K posts)
- Avoid overly generic (#love, #instagood)

---
